			Steam Account Protection, or SAP, is a Chrome extension that aims to protect you against several methods of
			attack.<br>
			Whether these are attacks targeting your Steam items or your Steam account, SAP helps you keep what belongs to
			you.<br><br>
			This extension is completely open-source and you can <a
				href="https://github.com/Armored-Dragon/Steam-Account-Protection" target="_blank">view the source code right now
				on GitHub</a>!

			<div class="header">Features</div>
			<div class="separator-line"></div>
			Trusted site icon:<br>
			<div class="indented-text">The Chrome icon will change color depending on what site you are visiting.<br>
				When you are on a trusted site like Steam, for example, the icon will change color to green.</div>
			<br>
			Buddy System<br>
			<div class="indented-text">The buddy system allows you to treat certain people with higher importance. Their
				information will be used to detect someone impersonating this user.</div>
			<br>
			Reputation Warning<br>
			<div class="indented-text">Reputation scanners use a Steam user profile identifier (SteamID) to check their
				reputation across SteamRep. Other services are used in a much more limited capacity. These reputations mostly
				affect their trading reliability, and if they are trustworthy.</div>
			<br>
			Impersonator Warning<br>
			<div class="indented-text">
				Impersonator scanners use multiple different aspects about a steam account, including
				their Personaname (Display name) and profile identifier to check if they could potentially be impersonating
				anyone. This works well with the Buddy system!
			</div>
			<br>
			API Detection<br>
			<div class="indented-text">API detection acts as an early warning for an API hijacking. Normally users do not
				have an API key registered to their account. This will alert the user if their account does get an API key.
